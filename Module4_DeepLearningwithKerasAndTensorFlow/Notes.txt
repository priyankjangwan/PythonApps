ImageNet :
Started in 2010, its basically a compition to create a large scale module or Image classification and object detection

1. What is this imagenet challenge ?
	Image net was designed to create vast dataset to use in visual recognization .
	
	started in 2010, its basically a compition to create a large scale module for Image classification and object detection.
	basically to expand and improve data , which can be used Image classification and object detection and train AI algorithm
	
	

2. What were the different models which performed well in this challenge yearwise ?

3. Which year was Alexnet introduced ?
