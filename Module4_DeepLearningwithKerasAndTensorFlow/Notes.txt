Alan Turing, Turing Awards, Turing Test - takeaway exercise


ImageNet :
Started in 2010, its basically a compition to create a large scale module or Image classification and object detection

1. What is this imagenet challenge ?
	Image net was designed to create vast dataset to use in visual recognization .
	
	started in 2010, its basically a compition to create a large scale module for Image classification and object detection.
	basically to expand and improve data , which can be used Image classification and object detection and train AI algorithm
	
	

2. What were the different models which performed well in this challenge yearwise ?

3. Which year was Alexnet introduced ?

4. What was so special about Alexnet ?

5. Find out what is special about the authors of Alexnet paper

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Think of a problem which may be what you are working on or it may be close to your heart

2. Think of a dataset ( type, availability, complexity etc)

3. Think of a model ( CNN, RNN, Transformers, GANs ....)

4. Think of Evaluating ( what metrics )
