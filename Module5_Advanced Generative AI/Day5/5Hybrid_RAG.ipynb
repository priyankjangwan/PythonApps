    "\n",
    "Organizations often need to analyze **large volumes of legal contracts** stored as PDFs, which contain nuanced clauses like **termination**, **non-compete**, and **confidentiality terms**. Purely semantic search (vector-based) or keyword search (BM25) alone may miss context or relevance.\n",
