    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "# An enterprise HR department stores employee policies, benefits, leave rules, and compliance documents in lengthy PDFs. Employees frequently ask repetitive questions like “How many remote days are allowed?” or “What’s the intern stipend?” — and HR struggles to scale this support efficiently.\n",

    "# # 5. **Parallel Processing**: Smaller chunks can be processed in parallel, speeding up the retrieval and generation process.\n",
    "# 6. **Flexibility**: Different chunks can be used for different queries, allowing for more tailored responses based on user needs.\n",
    "# 7. **Reduced Latency**: Smaller chunks can be retrieved and processed faster, improving the overall user experience.\n",
    "## 8. **Better Model Performance**: Language models often perform better with shorter, more focused text inputs, leading to higher quality responses.\n",
    "# 9. **Easier Debugging**: Smaller chunks make it easier to identify and fix issues in the text processing pipeline.\n",
    "# 10. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can quickly find relevant information without wading through large blocks of text\n",
    "# 11. **Improved Searchability**: Smaller chunks can be indexed more effectively, allowing for faster and more accurate search results.\n",
    "# 12. **Better Handling of Complex Documents**\n",
