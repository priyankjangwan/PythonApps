Classification Algo:
Regression Alog: 

simple leanear equation
	regression, We do it on infinite data. 
	Prediting a continueus vareable
	
	y = mx+c , simple leanear equation

multiple leanear regression
	when we have more leanear equations dependent on each others.. 
	
	
	Regressoin works on two things
	1. the independents are trully independent (not related to each other)
	2. 
	
----------------
Ordinary least square : to identify best fit values	, find out best fit line which is as close as to each points.. (+ , -) 	
	
R-squared: Increases when you add more variables, even if they are not useful.
Adjusted R-squared: Only increases if the new variable improves the model significantly.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
//  we cant use Lineal regression if there is a strong correlation between more than 2 features?
